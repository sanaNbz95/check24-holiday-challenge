# Welcome to Check24 Holiday Challenge!

## Note
I heard about your scholarship from my friend, and he did not told me that there is a coding challenge that I need to complete.
On 17th November, I wanted to apply it and suddenly I found out that there is a coding challenge.
So, I had only 3 days to complete the challenge.
I hope, it meets your expectations ;)

## Running

Firstly, install `pnpm` :

```sh
npm i -g pnpm

```


To run the app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Afterwards, start the app like so:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!
